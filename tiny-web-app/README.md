> A Vue.js project

## Personal message

Hi Thibault,

This challenge was for me a good way to rediscover and improve my skills on Vue.js. I didnâ€™t have many chances to use this technology so far.

For this project I used the Vue CLI tool which was for me the most convenient way to achieve it.

I chosed to focus on the features of the app (sorting sites by client, order of creation date, search option, edit profile), I believe the CSS still can be improved by nature.

I hope you enjoy reading my code as much as I enjoyed writing it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


## Build Heroku & Update

``` bash
# start serveur
npm run start

# open project in your favorite browser
http://localhost:5000/

#update Heroku
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push heroku master

# use this command for open app on ligne
heroku open 
(https://tiny-web-app.herokuapp.com/)
```
